# Kotlin Inline Functions

An inline function in Kotlin is a function that the compiler can replace with its body at the call site. In other words,
when you mark a function as `inline`, the compiler copies the function's code directly where it's called, instead of
creating a separate function call. This can eliminate the overhead of function call stack and object creation, which can
improve performance in certain situations.

## Advantages of Inline Functions

**Performance Optimization**

The primary advantage of inline functions is performance improvement. By eliminating the
overhead of function calls, they can make your code run faster, especially when used with lambdas.

**Lambda Expressions**

Inline functions are often used with higher-order functions that take lambda expressions as
parameters. Inlining the lambda code can save the overhead of creating anonymous classes or objects.

**Reduced Memory Allocation**

Since inline functions can eliminate object creation, they can help reduce memory allocation,
which is beneficial for Android app development and other resource-constrained environments.

## Disadvantages of Inline Functions

**Code Bloat**

Inlining functions can lead to code bloat, where the generated code becomes larger due to the repeated
inlined function bodies. This can increase the size of your compiled code, potentially affecting performance negatively.

**Increased Compile Time**

Inlining functions can increase compilation time, especially when used extensively, as the
compiler has to generate code for each call site.

## When to Use Inline Functions

**Small Functions**

Use inline functions for small, frequently-used functions, or functions that are part of a tight loop
where performance is critical.

**Higher-Order Functions**

Inline functions are particularly useful when working with higher-order functions like `map`,
`filter`, `forEach`, etc., as they can avoid the overhead of creating lambdas.

**Performance-Critical Code**

If you have performance-critical code that needs to be optimized for execution speed,
consider using inline functions.

**Library Design**

If you're designing a library or API that is intended for other developers to use, be cautious with
inline functions. They can have a ripple effect on the size of the generated code for the consumers of your library.
